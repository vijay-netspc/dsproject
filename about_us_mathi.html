            The National Service Scheme (NSS) at Thiagarajar College of Engineering is a platform for students to engage in meaningful community service, aiming to bring positive social change. Through our activities, we cultivate values of leadership, selflessness, and responsibility among students. Our mission is to bridge the gap between the academic world and societal needs, empowering students to become socially conscious and proactive citizens.
NSS TCE actively organizes a wide range of initiatives, including health camps, environmental awareness drives, rural development programs, and disaster relief efforts. With the vision of "Not Me, But You," we focus on enhancing studentsâ€™ holistic growth while contributing to the betterment of society.
Join us in our journey to make a difference!
